Study of Distribution of Android Vulnerabilities 

Background:
cvedetails provides a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities in all Android systems. The objective of this 
project is to parse the website, and analyze the source code information of each vulnerability

Objective
One of the missing pieces of cve is that it dose not group vulnerabilities by origin. Our first task is to do
just that. 

cvedetail analysis: 
Website reprots a vulnerability with the following sections: 

1. CVSS Score & Vulnerability Types
reports overall security impact of this vulnerability. Not important for this study for now

2. Products Affected By Vulerability
Reports Android version affected by the vulnerability. Not important at the moment

3. Number of affected versions by product
Not important for now

4. References for Vulnerability
References sometimes include source code. Important. 

5. Metasploit Modules related to Vulnerability
Not important for now




Our focus is on 4.

Approach:
Section 4 often contains links to the actual source code (android.googlesource.com). 
Being able to retrive this link for each vulnerability will allow us to trace the origin of each vulerability

Here are the steps in detail:
1. Retrieve all Android vulnerabilities from cvedetails, from the following link:
http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=1224&product_id=19997&version_id=&page=1&hasexp=0&opdos=0&opec=0&opov=0&opcsrf=0&opgpriv=0&opsqli=0&opxss=0&opdirt=0&opmemc=0&ophttprs=0&opbyp=0&opfileinc=0&opginf=0&cvssscoremin=0&cvssscoremax=0&year=0&month=0&cweid=0&order=1&trc=148&sha=1bd76566e804bd0baf4aa6ef43598ed24565b5b6

2. For each link, open, and parse out references for CVE-number. Search for all reference links

3. If link contains android.googlesource.com, visit that link. Parse out the source directory

4. Gather all directory and collect statistics

5. Cross reference the vulnerability by using http://androidvulnerabilities.org/all
